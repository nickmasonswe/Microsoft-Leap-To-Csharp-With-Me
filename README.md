Take a look into my journey learning C#
as a developer who has primarily used the Javascript/ Typescript and AWS ecosystems. 

This repo will contain snapshots of my early learning process,
including systematic learning and small projects. 

I'm Microsoft-LEAPing to learn this new language.
Any updates on how to best follow my journey will be reflected here. 

Happy coding!
